# Document Summarizer and Rewriter

## Overview

Document Summarizer and Rewriter is a Generative AI-powered application that analyzes documents and generates concise summaries and rewritten content in multiple communication styles. The application supports both a graphical user interface (GUI) through Streamlit and a command-line interface (CLI), providing flexibility for different user workflows.

This project was developed as part of a GenAI Internship Project.
